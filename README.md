## Why is the code obfuscated?
A: To prevent code changes and code theft, but this does not affect the script's functionality.

## How to use?
A: Just copy the entire contents of the script.js file and paste it into "Script Content" in BC.Game

## How does this script work?
A: After a certain number of losses, the bet increases. Multiplier and payout values are changeable (default loss streak = 3, default multiplier = 2, default payout = 5)
